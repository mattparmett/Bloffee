Title: Welcome to Bloffee!
Published: true
---

This is an example Bloffee post.  The date, title, and published status of the post must be specified at the top of the markdown file, as seen above.  (The dashed lines are unnecessary and Bloffee will ignore them, but they are useful to separate metadata from content.  In fact, the metadata can go anywhere in the post, as long as the above format is maintained.)

The body of the post is interpreted as Markdown, so all *Markdown syntax* will be translated into the appropriate html automatically.

You're going to want to customize the site header and description up top; to do that, rename blog.md.example to blog.md and follow the instructions inside the file.

If you want to alter how your Bloffee site looks, edit public/css/main.css to your liking.

Enjoy using Bloffee!  Any questions/comments are welcome at Bloffee's [GitHub page](http://github.com/mattparmett/bloffee).
